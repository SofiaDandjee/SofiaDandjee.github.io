<h3>I mean isn't it possible?</h3>

The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!

Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.

Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.

To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.

To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of anything more?

Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.
