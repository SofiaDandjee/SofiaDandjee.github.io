Keeping a good and balanced diet is fundamental to having a healthy life as it helps avoiding food-related illnesses such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. However, the price of the food products influences greatly the decisions of individuals in purchasing them or not. There is a strong belief amongst consumers that more expensive products are healthier than cheaper ones, even this is not always true. Thus, we ask ourselves: do people have an equal chance in maintaining a nutritious diet and thus a healthy life?
